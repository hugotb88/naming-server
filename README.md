# How to Register a microservice in Eureka
- in the POM of the microservice project add the dependency for Eureka client
```
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</artifactId>
    </dependency>
```
Additional, just to be sure, you can add the following to the properties file
``eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone = http://localhost:8761/eureka``

Before Add the depdendency in the microservices projects

#Client Side load balancing with Feign using spring-cloud-loadbalancer
- Is included in Eureka client dependency when you uses Feign Clients
- In old versions of Spring Cloud was called Ribbon
- The to implement it is removing the URL from the Feign
    - Then If there is more than one instance of the microservice running, the Spring Clouyd Load Balancer will check with Eureka the number of instances and will balance the load of requests.

# Spring Cloud Gateway to use the same common configuration between microservices
- In a typical Microservices architecture there are a lot of microservices (hundreds, thousands)
- A lot of them share common configurations
- Spring Cloud API Gateway does that work for you
  - In Earlier versions of Spring was called Zuul

# Spring Cloud Gateway to use the same common configuration between microservices
- In a typical Microservices architecture there are a lot of microservices (hundreds, thousands)
- A lot of them share common configurations
- Spring Cloud API Gateway does that work for you
  - In Earlier versions of Spring was called Zuul

Is registered automatically in Eureka, but to be sure, you can configure the properties file
``eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone = http://localhost:8761/eureka``

# Enable the ability to discover microservices talking with EUREKA and using the name convention in Eureka http://localhost:8761 (e.g) CURRENCY-EXCHANGE
```spring.cloud.gateway.discovery.locator.enabled = true```

Allows to talk With Eureka and use the name of the application to go to the service through the name registered
e.g

```
  Original URL  
  http://localhost:8100/currency-conversion-feign/from/USD/to/MXN/quantity/10

  Using Spring Gateway 
  http://localhost:8765/CURRENCY-EXCHANGE/currency-exchange/from/USD/to/MXN

```

To avoid the upper case in the url add the following to properties

``spring.cloud.gateway.discovery.locator.lowerCaseServiceId = true``

Then...
```
  Original URL
  http://localhost:8100/currency-conversion-feign/from/USD/to/MXN/quantity/10
  
  Using Spring Gateway 
  http://localhost:8765/currency-exchange/currency-exchange/from/USD/to/MXN
```

# Circuit Breaker using Resilience4j (Earlier Hystrix)
![img_4.png](img_4.png)

- Inspired in Netflix Hystrix
- Review Resilience4j site to check if the followind dependencies are the only ones that we need to add:
  - actuator
  - spring boot2
  - spring aop

```
  		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
		</dependency>
		
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-aop</artifactId>
		</dependency>

		<dependency>
			<groupId>io.github.resilience4j</groupId>
			<artifactId>resilience4j-spring-boot2</artifactId>
		</dependency>
        
```

# Distributed Tracing (Zipkin Server)
- Â¿How you can trace a request tha travels across a lot of Microservices?
  - Using Distributed Tracing

![](img_8.png)


# Setting up Zipkin Server with Docker
``docker run -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin:2.23``
- That will pull or run that specific image of Zipkin Server in a Docker container.
- Go to ``http://localhost:9411/zipkin/`` the server will be up and running.

- Configure in the project the following dependencies:
```
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-sleuth</artifactId>
    </dependency>
```

This library helps to assign an id per request

```
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-cloud-sleuth-zipkin</artifactId>
    </dependency>
```

This one adds Zipkin

```
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.amqp</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-rabbit</artifactId>
  </dependency>
```

Optional, this is for the AMQP and RabbitMQ and keep the requests in the queue, in this way if the Zipkin server is down, we are not loosing the information of the requests.
![](img_10.png)

# Configuring Sampling
This allows to analyze a percentage of the requests as sampling

in properties file (1.0 means 100% of the requests)
``spring.sleuth.sampler.probability = 1.0``

Run the microservice, Zipkin, send a request and Refresh Zipkin in browser
![](img_12.png)

# Sleuth library
- Allows to assign an ID to each one of the requests.
- In this way you can trace and track where a request (In which microservice) is failing

# Docker compose
- It's a tool to define and execute applications of several Docker containers
- Configured in a YAML file
- Basically you can run a los of applications configuring the in the Docker compose file.
- Reference https://github.com/in28minutes/spring-microservices-v2/tree/main/04.docker
  - You can download that repo and the resources are there


## Install Docker Compose
- For Windows is included in the .exe that installs docker.

``docker compose --version``

Docker compose file example (docker-compose.yaml)
- Use spaces instead Tabs (2 spaces)
- It is in YAML format
- Each container is called "service" in the compose file
- Usually a network is created
```
version: '3.7'
services:
  currency-exchange:
    image: hugotb88/mmv2-currency-exchange-service:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
    mem_limit: 700m
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    networks:
      - currency-network
        
networks:
  currency-network:
```

If you want to run that docker compose file
- Go to the directory where the file is
  ``docker-compose up``


# Creating a Docker compose for Currency Exchange Service
- Add the following in the pom.xml:

```
<configuration>
  <image>
    <name>hugotb88/mmv2-${project.artifactId}:${project.version}</name>
  </image>
  <pullPolicy>IF_NOT_PRESENT</pullPolicy>
</configuration> 
```

- configuration --> start of image configuration
- name --> {id}/name_of_the_image
- pullPolicy --> IF_NOT_PRESENT means that always will create and image if not exists

Result in pom.xml
```
<build>
  <plugins>
      <plugin>
          <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
          <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
          <configuration>
              <image>
                  <name>hugotb88/mmv2-${project.artifactId}:${project.version}</name>
              </image>
              <pullPolicy>IF_NOT_PRESENT</pullPolicy>
          </configuration>
      </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
```

Then run a Maven build with the following goals
``spring-boot:build-image -DskipTests``

![](img_11.png)

![](img_13.png)

Then you can use your image using the following command:

``docker run -p 8761:8761 hugotb88/mmv2-naming-server:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT``

![](img_15.png)

## Additional thing added to Docker compose file

```
depends_on:
      - naming-server
environment:
  EUREKA.CLIENT.SERVICEURL.DEFAULTZONE: http://naming-server:8761/eureka
```

depends-on --> Indicates that the current-exchange container needs first the naming-server service.

environment --> Environment variable, we replaced localhost for naming-server, because localhost is not the same inside Docker than in our machines, in this way Eureka (naming-server) can discovers the currency-exchange service, its the same property that we have in the properties file in the currency-exchange service but in uppercase and replacing '=' for ':'.
